# 🚀 Welcome to Your Web Project

## 🧾 Project Overview

This is your freshly scaffolded modern web app — built with speed, style, and a stack that won’t quit halfway through a sprint.

You’ve got everything set up and ready to run, whether you're hacking in VSCode, pushing through GitHub, or deploying with your favorite platform.

## 🛠️ Editing the Code Like a Pro

Choose your own adventure:

### 🧑‍💻 Local Development (the old-fashioned but powerful way)

All you need is [Node.js + npm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) installed. Then:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo (replace with your actual Git URL)
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# 2. Move into the project directory
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Fire up the dev server (with hot reload and strong opinions)
npm run dev
